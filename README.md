# PixelEngine

PixelEngine is a Qt/C++ based 2d game engine, which is designed
to be extremely simple, fast and resource efficient.

It's designed to supplement in areas where big engine like Unreal or Unity are lacking.

Especially for developement of simple games with pixel based, dynamic and fluid terrain,
like Scorched Earth or Worms

# Features
* Cross-platform: GNU/Linux, MacOS, Windows, Android, iOS
* Running game in web browsers supported via WebAssembly
* Simple, fast and efficient design
* True LGPLv3 open-source with no hidden license obstructions

# Reasoning behind creating own engine while hundreds exist

I really love Unreal Engine, unfortunatelly for me - I am programmer, not designer.
The way epic went (blueprints and similar BS), made creating games easier for
artists but a far harder for actual developers (who prefer C++ interface any time).
The editor and egine are now so bulky that it's really hard to run on anything with
slow CPU and HW.

I like to create remakes of old pixel based DOS games I was playing as kid.

I need a quick, simple, C++, open source 2d engine that doesn't limit me in any way.

Finally I decided I will have to make one, since my needs are not covered by any of
the existing ones.
